# bucketList
Playing around with backend. Learning how to add different backend functionality using flask
I was able to create this using flask and bootstrap.
<h1>Home Page>
<img src="./photos/home.png">
<p>the home page is meant to display the items that a user will post to their bucket list after logging in</p>
<h1>sign up</h1>
<img src="./photos/signup.png">
<p>Here the user can create an account and add it to the mySQL database I created to store user information</p>
<h1>sign in</h1>
<img src="./photos/signin.png">
<p> I created sign in functionality so that a user can log in. The log in works by querying the database and checking to see if the user exists</p>
<br>
<p>... more functionality to come</p>
